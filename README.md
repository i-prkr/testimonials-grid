## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Parcel (Bundler https://parceljs.org/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first time using Sass extensively, and was surprised by how powerful it is. On top of learning the basics of Sass I was able to also implement some maps and Sass functions for dynamic styling. I also learned and begun using the BEM styling method, that pairs well with Sass.

### Continued development

I'm keen to continue working with both Sass and BEM styling. While it can be overkill to use Sass for such a simple small project I also recognise how effective it can be for scaling and reusability for other projects.
